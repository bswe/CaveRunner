**A JavaFX implementation of a game similar to Lode Runner**

This repository is an exploration into using Java, and in particular JavaFX, to implement a game similar to the old Lode Runner game.  It uses graphical images 'lifted' from the *LODE RUNNER ON-LINE - The Mad Monks' Revenge* game released on Windows XP.  It is expected to behave very similary to the original game with a few deviations which I feel make it more realistic and complex (to be explained as I go along).

More to come as I add functionality.
